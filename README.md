# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

- This is my first jQuery, moment.js and Bootstrap framework homework assignment for the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
- The homework assignment was to create a Work Day Scheduler that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. A starter HTML code was provided, but all of the JS was up to me. 
- Using moment.js the day scheduler hour blocks dynamically update their background color depending on the hour blocks relation to the current moment.js live time. For example, hour blocks display a gray background color if they have already past. A red background color is used for present hour, and a green background color to represent hour blocks in the future.
- In completing this assignment I was able to apply the lessons from week five: using jQuery to manipulate the DOM in my JS file, work with the Bootstrap framework to modify my HTML and use already established classes in CSS, work with moment.js, and save and retrieve data to and from the local storage. 

The following is a desktop screenshot of the final version of the webpage when it was first submitted for review (Notice: The screenshot was taken after the last hour block on the scheduler so all background colors are gray):
